# climate_server
Climate control server

This is a back-end file to control a heater system, it can also be used for A/C. I'm still developing some functionalities as reading temperature from multiple sensors in the hosue

As you can appreciate in the first lines of code is only running in a localhost. 

To see the server running download the file and use the command node climate_server.js

Thanks for reading!
